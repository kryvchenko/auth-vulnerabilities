# Authentication Vulnerabilities

This repository is dedicated to exploring Authentication vulnerabilities, providing examples of common authentication flaws, potential attack vectors, and strategies for mitigation. This repo utilizes PortSwigger's infrastructure and servers, such as those provided by [web-security-academy.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security) for free penetration testing practice.

## Introduction to Authentication Vulnerabilities

Authentication vulnerabilities arise when an application fails to adequately verify the identity of users, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to impersonate users, escalate privileges, or bypass authentication mechanisms entirely, resulting in data breaches or compromised accounts.

## Common Authentication Attack Scenarios

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers systematically try multiple combinations of usernames and passwords until they find valid credentials.
2. **Credential Stuffing**: Using previously leaked credentials from other sites, attackers attempt to gain access to accounts by reusing passwords that users have set elsewhere.
3. **Session Hijacking**: An attacker steals a valid session token (often from cookies or URL parameters) and uses it to authenticate as the victim.
4. **Password Reset Flaws**: Vulnerabilities in the password reset process can allow attackers to reset a user's password without proper authorization.
5. **Insecure Password Storage**: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms enables attackers to easily retrieve them if the storage system is compromised.

## Example Attack Vectors

### Brute Force Attack

\`\`\`bash

# Example brute force attack using a common wordlist to guess passwords

POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin&password=123456
\`\`\`

### Credential Stuffing

\`\`\`bash

# Automated attack where the attacker tries multiple known credentials from a leak

POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=john_doe&password=p@ssw0rd123
\`\`\`

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adding a second layer of authentication drastically reduces the risk of account compromise.
2. **Rate Limiting and Lockout Mechanisms**: Limit the number of failed login attempts from an IP address and lock accounts after several unsuccessful attempts to mitigate brute force attacks.
3. **Use Strong Password Hashing Algorithms**: Ensure that user passwords are stored using algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2, with proper salting.
4. **Secure Password Reset Mechanisms**: Verify identity through multi-step processes during password resets, and ensure that reset links expire after a short period.
5. **Regularly Update Password Policies**: Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords and educate users about avoiding password reuse across different sites.
